# NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

<ul>
  <li>a powerful N-dimensional array object</li>
  <li>sophisticated (broadcasting) functions</li>
  <li>tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code</li>
  <li>useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities</li>
</ul>

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
