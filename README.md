NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

<ul>
  <li>a powerful N-dimensional array object</li>
  <li>sophisticated (broadcasting) functions</li>
  <li>tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code</li>
  <li>useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities</li>
</ul>

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

## Installing Packages

### For many users, especially on Windows, the easiest way to begin is to download one of these Python distributions, which include all the key packages:
<ul>
  <li>Anaconda: A free distribution of Python with scientific packages. Supports Linux, Windows and Mac.</li>
<li>Enthought Canopy: The free and commercial versions include the core scientific packages. Supports Linux, Windows and Mac.</li>
<li>Python(x,y): A free distribution including scientific packages, based around the Spyder IDE. Windows and Ubuntu; Py2 only.</li>
<li>WinPython: Another free distribution including scientific packages and the Spyder IDE. Windows only, but more actively maintained and supports the latest Python 3 versions.</li>
<li>Pyzo: A free distribution based on Anaconda and the IEP interactive development environment. Supports Linux, Windows and Mac.</li>
  </ul>

## Installing via PIP Command in Terminal / Command Prompt
